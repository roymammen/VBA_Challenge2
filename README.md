# VBA_Challenge
1.	Overview and Purpose: 
	To help Steve analyze a data set of stock transactions to analyze for Steve's parents who are planning to invest in an "alternate energy" stock. 
	
	Also, to identify if there is a possible diversification coming out of analysis.
	
	To complete this process, help Steve, write VBA scripts to summarize overall performance of several stocks in 2017 and 2018
	
	The data set and VBA script summary can help Steve's parents to take a more informed decision on investing into the future.
	
	Also refactor the code to be more efficient and take less resources.

	Analysis: Using the data set from 2017 and 2018 a VBA script was written that would summarize as follows
	
	a. in 2017 almost all stocks gave a positive returns, in 2018 majority of the stocks underperformed except ENPH and RUN.
	
	b. Both years ENPH and RUN gave positive results is a good indication for recommending this stock, along with sustained volume
	
2.	Results: 

	Execution times of the original script and the refactored script. The execution of the script are more or less linear. 

	2017 alone sheet was processed in 1.46 seconds. 

	2018 sheets were processed in 1.53 seconds.

	The script has no abnormal issues and should be reasonable and scalable given more data should be added.
3.	In a summary statement, address the following questions. 

	Advantage: Advantage of refactoring a code is to have code run faster with lesser resources and memory while giving the same results.

	Disadvantage: One major disadvantage of refactoring is plan for proper testing to avoid any bugs.

	Pros: VBA can be used to achieve completing repetitive tasks on a data set to get meaningful results and summary. 
	VBA is easy to implement given Microsoft support. 

	Cons: VBA editing and debugging is a bit difficult, but doable. 
	The run time errors are not straightforward and there is an extra amount of time spent to get a working solution.
